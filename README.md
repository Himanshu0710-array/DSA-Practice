## 📚 About the Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of solving **DSA problems** systematically from **Striver’s SDE Sheet / A2Z DSA Sheet**.  
It covers all major **topics in data structures and algorithms**, including:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Binary Trees & BST  
- Heaps, Graphs, Greedy, DP  
- Bit Manipulation & Sliding Window  

Each solution is written in **clean, well-commented C++ code**, focusing on **clarity, efficiency, and standard problem-solving patterns**.
